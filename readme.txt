Configuration Guide (settings/config.json)
To properly configure WRANSCAN, follow these steps:

1. VirusTotal API Key (VT_API_KEY)
Enter your VirusTotal API key inside the "VT_API_KEY" field.
You can obtain your API key by signing up for a free VirusTotal account. Once logged in, your API key will be available in your dashboard.

2. File Extensions (FILE_EXTENSIONS)
Specify the file extensions you want WRANSCAN to scan.
You can add or remove extensions as needed—there is no limit.

3. Starting Directory (STARTING_PATH)
Define the directory where the scan should begin.
WRANSCAN will recursively scan all subdirectories within this path.

4. Scan Speed (SPEED)
Set the scan speed by specifying a numerical value.
A higher number increases the scanning speed, but excessively high values may impact system performance.
Recommended range: 5–10.
